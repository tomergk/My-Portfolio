# My Portfolio

Welcome to my web development portfolio! This repository showcases a collection of web projects I've created to demonstrate my skills and share my knowledge. While there's no backend in this project, it serves as a valuable resource to highlight my frontend development capabilities.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:
### `npm start`
This script allows you to start the development server for the project. It is typically used during the development phase to preview your web application in your local environment. After running this command, you should be able to access your project in a web browser at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) or a different port if specified.

Make sure you have Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) installed on your system before running this command.

## Technologies
In the creation of these projects, I have employed a wide range of technologies and tools, including but not limited to:

- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript (ES6+)
- React
- Bootstrap
- jQuery
- EJS
- mongoDB
- Express
- Responsive design
- Git and version control

These technologies have enabled me to craft user-friendly and visually appealing web applications while adhering to modern best practices in web development.

## Usage
